GILL ARCHES:
* Ceratobranchial curvature (2nd order polynomial)
* Number of gill rakers per arch
* Avg. height of gill rakers on 1st arch
* 1st epibranch:
	- aspect ratio
	- size relative to ceratobranch
* length of hyoid series (i.e. floor of mouth)

CRANIAL SKELETON:
* Lower jaw length
* Upper jaw length
* Head depth at 1st dorsal fin
* Head depth at posterior tip of mouth
* Head depth at anterior point
	- measuring slope of head & roundness/pointiness
* Head length (LJ to operculum)
* Head width at same points as measured head depth

PHARYNGEAL CAVITY:
