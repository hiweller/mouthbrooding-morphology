1) ICVM abstract due on Feb. 1 - catfish swallowing?
	- Definitely!
	
2) UMMZ/FMNH collections visits:
     - Collecting morphological data - clearing & staining vs. CT scanning vs. dissecting; 2D photographs vs 3D of some kind, etc
     - Potential comparative methods for the data
     - General expectations for the trip (one-on-one and lab meetings, G1/G2 seminars, other projects)

- PRESCAN BEFORE STAINING
- does cartilage PMA stain?

- bony facial landmarks
	- flesh this out
	- lower jaw length
	- 2D slices of cross-section: oral and gill cavity
	- check existing, non-pma CT scans
	- just save the 2D image!
- reduce number of species to compare
	- Neurocranium length
	- hyoid length
	- jaw length
	- head width

UMMZ: Gymnogeophagus??

3) Other next steps for quals:
    - General chapter topics?
    - Roadmap - timeline, what needs to get done, who I ask about which specific problems, what expectations are, etc

- send a list to Beth of what catfish stuff to get done while gone on trip!!!


4) Catfish swallowing project:
    - Feels like it's time to start writing it up? 
    - add screenshots of pharyngeal jaws 

Order:
	- Figures, figure legends, results
	- don't spend too much time tweaking...

5) Broader check-in on how I'm doing in the lab - anything I'm not doing (or not doing enough), communication, etc.
