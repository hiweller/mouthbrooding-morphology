Does morphology matter for mouthbrooding?
* Can I predict the likelihood that a species mouthbroods by looking at the morphology? 
* **Can I predict the morphology of a mouthbrooder?**


Do these changes actually help with mouthbrooding? How?



Is there an overlap between feeding morphology and mouthbrooding morphology? * What comes first?



To what degree are all mouthbrooding morphologies convergent? 
* Same mechanical solution (bigger mouth)? 
* Same morphological changes (bigger mouth via neurocranium concavity)?
* Same behaviors (tumbling, premax protrusion)?


Can you get equivalently effective changes just through behavior/pose changes?
