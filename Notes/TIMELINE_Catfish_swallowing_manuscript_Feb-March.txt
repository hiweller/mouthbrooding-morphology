WEEKS 1 & 2:
1) Make figures & write captions:
	- X-ray/Maya animation screenshots
	- Prey trajectories
	- Avg. velocities, path efficiencies
	- Head/prey motion correlations across phases
	- Pseudo-rotoscoping of pharyngeal jaws (lateral view only)

WEEK 3:
2) Statistical analyses:
	- Change in velocity, efficiency at 55% HL, controlling for food type and individual
	- Correlation between head motions and food motions in pharyngeal vs. esophageal phase

WEEKS 4 & 5:
3) Draft methods and results sections

4) Read background literature, especially mammalian swallowing literature and water-land feeding transition literature

WEEK 6:
4) Outline discussion

WEEK 7:
5) Outline intro and abstract
