WEEK OF MARCH 1:
- Identified many of the un-identified Bujurquina in Peru lots. Tedious.
- Began dissecting neotropical cichlids from last time I was here (ones that are already stained/partially dissected).
- Guianacara = winnowing geophagine, no mouthbrooding...
	- Interesting oral cavity. G. geayi is classic biter, G. owroewefi has a cavernous oral cavity -- almost looks like Tylochromis. 
	- COULD BE A SIZE ISSUE -- FMNH fish that were already pulled out are considerably smaller than UMMZ ones, by about 1cm. Guianacara gets pretty big.
- Currently, thinking that it makes sense to focus on four specific weirdo genera while I'm here:
	- Geophagus
	- Satanoperca
	- Gymnogeophagus
	- Bujurquina
	- Andinoacara (sister to Bujurquina, doesn't winnow or MB)
- First three are all geophagines, and in each genus, there's like a 60/40 split between mouthbrooders and non-mouthbrooders. So it's either been gained or lost at least once in each genus. WTF!
- Bujurquina -- various levels of mouthbrooding (complete to delayed) across the genus, but not a winnower.
- One thing I'm thinking: what is the correlation between external morphology (i.e. dermal bones, adductor mandibulae, eye placement, etc etc -- classic geomorph) and oral cavity shape? Does deep head==big cavity, shallow head==linear cavity? 

MARCH 8, 2019:
- Doing catfish stuff all day. Boy, has that thing been a learning experience.
