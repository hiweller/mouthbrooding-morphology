Gill morphology (general notes)
From: Vandewalle et al. 2000, "The branchial basket in teleost feeding"

MUSCLES:
Levatores externi: 
	- INSERT: epibranchial
	- ATTACH: neurocranium
	- four total on each side of the gill basket
	- FUNCTION: adduct the left and right UPJs

Levatores interni:
	- INSERT: 2nd & 3rd pharyngobranchials
	- ATTACH: neurocranium
	- FUNCTION: lift UPJs and shift them forward

Transversi dorsales:
	- INSERT: left epibranchials
	- ATTACH: right epibranchials
	- FUNCTION: adduct epibranchials (bring left and right together)
	- always between second and third epibranchials
	- sometimes between ceratobranchial and epibranchial of same arch
	- FUNCTION: fifth adductor between fourth epibranchial and fifth ceratobranchial
		- lifts the posterior part of one LPJ

Transversi ventrales:
	- INSERT/ATTACH: left and right 4th  and 5th ceratobranchials
	- FUNCTION: adduct LPJs

Rectus communis:
	- INSERT/ATTACH: 5th ceratobranchial to 3rd hypobranchial
	- FUNCTION: lower the LPJ

Pharyngocleithrales interni and externi:
	- INSERT: pectoral girdle
	- ATTACH: LPJs
	- FUNCTION: interni - draw PJs posteriorly; externi - draw PJs downward

Sternohyoideus:
	- INSERT: urohyal
	- ATTACH: pectoral girdle
	- FUNCTION: pull the hyobranchial system backward

Geniohyoidei:
	- INSERT: lower jaw
	- ATTACH: hyoid bars
	- FUNCTION: pull system forward

**Acanthopterygians**

- Levatores externi and interni are turned forward
	- FUNCTION: lift, protract, and separate the UPJs
	- fourth levator externus is more developed


Levator posterior:
	- INSERT: back of the skull
	- ATTACH: fourth epibranchial

Retractor posterior:
	- INSERT: third (or higher) pharyngobranchial
	- ATTACH: ventral surface of first vertebrae
	- FUNCTION: lifts and pulls each UPJ backward

Pharyngohyoideus
	- homologous to rectus communis
	- INSERT: 5th ceratobranchial
	- ATTACH: urohyal
	- FUNCTION: movement of LPJs (lowering, pulling apart left and right, forward displacement)







MOVEMENTS AND FUNCTIONS

* Pharyngeal jaws are associated with macrophagous diets, and branchiospines (gill rakers) associated with microphagous diet.














Okuda et al. 2002, "Sexual difference in buccal morphology of the paternal mouthbrooding cardinalfish Apogon doederleini"

* Standard length (SL): rostral tip of upper jaw to caudal peduncle
* Head length (HL): anterior tip of upper jaw to posterior end of operculum
* Snouth length (SNL): rsotral tip of upper jaw to rostral edge of eye
* Upper jaw length (UJL): anterior end of premax to distal tip of maxilla
* Lower jaw length (LJL): Anterior of dentary to rear of articular
* Dentary-hypohyal (Dnt-Hyp): rostral dentary to caudal hypohyal
* Cheek depth (CD): ventral margin of orbit to caudal tip of maxilla
* Interorbital width (IOW): b/w dorsal bony margins of L and R orbits
* Head depth (HD): caudal tip of premaxillary pedical to rostral tip of hypohyal
* Mouth width: Posterior tips of the left and right maxillae
* Angular width (AW): outer edges of left and right angulars
* Infraorbital width (IFW): outer points of L and R infraorbitals

Analytical method:
- PCA to extract overall patterns of covariation among morphometric variables (obviously all correlated with each other)
- used extracted components as explanatory variables in a MLR model
- also tried using all morphometircs together in MLR after size correcting (i.e. residuals of log-log regressions against body size)

Significant differences between mouthbrooding and non-mouthbrooding sex:
- Head length*
- Snout length*
- Lower jaw length*
- Dentary-hypohyal length**
- Infraorbital-hypohyal length
- Head depth*
- Mouth width (borderline)
- Angular width**
- Urohyal length*
- Urohyal aspect ratio*
- sternohyoideus as a stabilizer for depressed urohyal? (speculation)
