During this stage, the breeding pair swims near the water surface usually at night. ""The male chases the female around the perimeter of the tank. Sometimes, the pair circle each other nose-to-tail. About one to two weeks before spawning takes place, the fish swim side by side with their bodies touching. Eventually, the female releases a cluster of orange-red eggs. The male fertilises the eggs and then scoops them into its mouth where it incubates them. After hatching which occurs in about a week, the young larvae continue to live in the male's mouth for 7-8 weeks more until  the yolk sac is totally absorbed"" (Ref. 57886).",NA,6357

For several days prior to the estimated egg-laying time, the pairs were in continuous close company, swimming near the surface. Courting activities include close following, intermittent angled swimming (head down), vent nudging and lifting by the male. Individual males are capable of participating in at least two spawnings per season. A male will repair with a new available female within several weeks of an initial mating.
Females carrying unhatched eggs or larvae in the mouth are distinguished by a conspicuous white chin during the incubation period. Incubating females spend more time at the surface, exhibit no aggression to other non-carrying individuals and show no interest in food. Occasionally two incubating females will briefly act aggressively towards each other. During the latter stages of incubation the females concerned continually circle and inspect shallow shore areas.
Temporary release and recall of developing larvae occurs during daylight hours. The female comes into the littoral shallows, releases the full brood and continues swimming slowly parallel to the bank. Larvae maintain station around the head of the adult with individuals making brief excursions to the pond edge. The released juveniles are observed closely by the female. A sudden kinking movement of her body is followed by the rapid return of young to her mouth"" (Ref. 39857).",NA,7537
