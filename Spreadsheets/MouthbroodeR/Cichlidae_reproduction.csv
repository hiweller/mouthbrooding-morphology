719,Oreochromis andersonii,in mouth,external brooders,NA,"Spawning did not occur in ponds at a temperature below 21å¡C (Ref. 2).  Rarely more than one brood in a season (Ref. 87, 246), but known to breed at least twice a year under pond conditions (Ref. 12524, 13337).  Males excavate saucer-shaped nests (Ref. 246, 314, 6465, 12524, 13337, 54048) that can be up to 75cm in diameter and 30cm deep, using mouth and fins (Ref. 2, 314, 52307), in the center of their territory (Ref. 52307), on a sandy substrate (any vegetation is uprooted with its mouth) and in water from 1-3m deep, where they display to attract females (Ref. 12524, 13337, 54048).  Up to 40 nests can be found together (Ref. 6465).  Females are the primary care-givers (Ref. 52307), moutbrooding eggs, larvae and fry; multiple broods are raised during the warmer months (Ref. 7248, 52193).  She lays her eggs in the concavity on top of the nest, the male fertilizes the eggs whereupon the female takes the eggs into her mouth where they are incubated; males guard the nest and females against all intruders; parental care is exercised for the first few weeks after the eggs hatch (Ref. 12524, 13337).",y
720,Oreochromis aureus,external,external brooders,maternal,"Nesting usually in shallow water weedy areas (Ref. 96).  Males establish territory and dig a spawning pit (Ref. 2, 6465, 54601), using mouth and fins (Ref. 2), up to 60cm deep and 4-6m in diameter; a number of territories can often be found clustered together (Ref. 52307).  Territories are defended by means of agressive behaviour (Ref. 6465), including lateral display, lateral biting and mouth-to-mouth combat (Ref. 2).  Reproduction is stimulated by long photoperiods and inhibited by short daylengths (Ref. 54365).  Reproduction requires a minimum temperature of about 20å¡C (Ref. 2).  Males visit schools of females and attempt to attract a female spawning partner (Ref. 2, 52307).  Courting behaviour in the nest consists of lateral display by both sexes with nipping and tail-flapping (Ref. 2).  Eggs are deposited in single clutches, from several dozen to 100 eggs (Ref. 52307), and are taken into the females mouth as soon as they are fertilized (Ref. 2, 6465, 52307),  with a peak spawning frequency around the 9-11th hour of light (Ref. 31140, 54365).  One female may hold up to 2000 eggs in her mouth (Ref. 2).  The female swims away to deeper water with the brood after spawning is complete (Ref. 2, 52307), while the male renews spawning activities with another female.  Hatching occurs about 3 days after oviposition (Ref. 2).  Incubation time varies with temperature, 13-14 days at 25-27å¡C (Ref. 2, 52307) or 8-10 days at 29å¡C (Ref. 144), and juveniles leave the mother's mouth when they are about 1.1cm in length (Ref. 54601).  The young school near parent's head for a few days, reentering the mouth at any sign of danger or at a gesture of the female;  parent-offspring relationship ceases after 5 days (Ref. 2).",y
721,Oreochromis esculentus,in mouth,external brooders,NA,"Reproduction probably triggered by the rains (Ref. 2771), with the time of maximum spawning activity coinciding with the wettest months of the year (Ref. 363).  Males form a crater-like spawning nest without a distinct wall (Ref. 27292).  The pit is about 30cm in diameter and 10cm deep, and is probably made in the early morning (Ref. 27292).  Ovaries show that a female may have a succession of three or more broods in a spawning period; brooding females often shelter in weed beds and swampy places (Ref. 2, 363).  Males defend their breeding territory (Ref. 2) for weeks or on and off for several months, while females only make short visits to the spawning grounds and leave the territory immediately after spawning (Ref. 363).  Males eat little while actively guarding the nest (Ref. 363).  Papyrus swamp channels (Ref. 363, 34921, 55020) and beaches with weed grown swamps (Ref. 34921) function as nursery areas.  Young become independent at a length of about 1.5cm (Ref. 2, 363)by which size the yolk sac is occluded and they have strated to feed (Ref. 363), and at about 12cm TL they move from the nursery areas to the open water (Ref. 2).",y
722,Oreochromis jipe,in mouth,external brooders,NA,"Breeding pits may be similar to those of <i>O. pangani</i>, consisting of a central pit surrounded by two or three series of smaller pits (Ref. 2, 55060).",y
723,Oreochromis karomo,external,external brooders,NA,"Males construct and maintain a mating platform which is a circular area of fine sand (Ref. 2), usually only about 10-15cm in diameter which is much smaller than the length of the fish (Ref. 55077), surrounded by a low ridge, on the top of a mound about 10 cm high (Ref. 2), but the mound might be 1m in diameter at its base and 30cm high (Ref. 55074, 55077).  The plaque of sand is kept very clean, making the nest visible from a considerable distance (Ref. 55077).  Little boundary fighting between close neighbours, but males seen to drive away individuals of other species (e.g. <i>Labeo</i> and <i>Clarias</i> as well as other cichlids)(Ref. 2, 55077).  Females are seen in the nests at various times throughout the day; the number of times a male spawns appears to be limited by the number of ripe females available; females cruise over the spawning grounds singly or in small shoals (Ref. 55077).  Courtship behaviour short and not particularly complex (Ref. 364), including displaying by the male to attract a female, snout shaking (nose wagging) and tassel dragging (Ref. 364, 55077).  Female lays a batch of eggs and immediately picks them up while the male drags his tassel over the nest (Ref. 2, 55077), but it remains unclear whether the eggs are fertilised in the water or in the mouth of the female (Ref. 55077).  2, 3 or more batches of eggs may be laid by the same female before she leaves the nest (Ref. 2, 55077), and the larger the female the more numerous the eggs (Ref. 55077).  Normal spawning generally takes less than 5 minutes (Ref. 55077).  Breeding individuals spend little time feeding (Ref. 2), and males do not leave their territory to feed (Ref. 5507).  Young of 11mm still with large yolk sacs were the largest seen from the mouth of a female (Ref. 55077).  Young of 2-6cm remain in schools in the shallows (Ref. 2, 55077).",y
724,Oreochromis karongae,in mouth,external brooders,NA,"Breeding period extends over several months as noted in Lake Malombe, at present one of the main breeding areas for this species (Ref. 6150).  Males build nests on a variety of substrata and at depths of 0.5m to at least 28m; nests generally 0.3-1.9m diameter, with dimensions correlated to male size (Ref. 55079).  Nest with a characteristic spawning cone in its center (Ref. 5595).  Courtship appears to occur mainly in the early morning (Ref. 40193, 55079), and consist of leading, followed by tilting and head-down quivering if the female follows the male to the nest (Ref. 40193).  A female with 324 young of 15mm long in the mouth has been caught (Ref. 2781).  Females keep guarding their fry until they are about 24 mm (Ref. 2781, 6150).",y
725,Oreochromis leucostictus,in mouth,external brooders,NA,"Breeds over shallow muddy bottoms in sheltered inlets and in the papyrus fringe (Ref. 56123).  Ripe males are found near the bottom over particular nesting areas (Ref. 39939).  Males establish territory and make a nest by mouth-digging (Ref. 2), actively preventing invasion by other fishes (Ref. 39939).  Nests made in shallow water, 15-300cm deep (Ref. 2, 56123), 16-20cm in diameter and 1-4m apart, dug in coarse leaf-debris or on shallow muddy bottoms (Ref. 2, 39939).  Brooding females from the lagoons are found in pools adjacent to the lagoons/nursery swamps (Ref. 2, 39939).  Fry spent their early days in shallow, grassy (Ref. 2, 32297, 39939) and deoxygenated swamps (Ref. 56123), but move to deeper water as their length increases (Ref. 32297, 39939).",y
726,Oreochromis lidole,in mouth,external brooders,NA,"Seems to be sexually mature at a smaller size in Lakes Chungruru and Kingiri than in Lake Malawi (Ref. 2, 54852).  Spawns off clean sandy or rocky shores (Ref. 2, 87, 2781) in deeper water (Ref. 2, 87, 2781, 5595, 6150, 40193).  Territorial males build a large (Ref. 5595, 40193, 55079) sand-castle nest, with a characteristic spawning cone in its center (Ref. 2, 5595).  Females congregate in schools that may number hundreds of individuals (Ref. 2, 2781, 5595).  The male genital tassel, which develops together with the breeding dress and imitates a clutch of eggs, is dragged through the nest after the females has deposited some eggs, which are picked up immediately; the female probably mistakes the tassel for eggs that have been forgotten and tries to collect them as well, which results in the eggs being fertilized (Ref. 5595).  Females carrying eggs in the mouth move into open, more eutrophic waters, and stay there until the young have almost lost the yolk sac; they feed little during this time (Ref. 2781).  Females brood eggs/young, guarding their fry until about 52(-58)mm (Ref. 2, 2781).  Females move inshore with their young for at least part of the day; the young are spat out to feed, and food (small phytoplankton) is found in the foregut before the involuted yolk-sac is fully absorbed (Ref. 2781).",y
727,Oreochromis macrochir,in mouth,external brooders,NA,"Breeds in summer (Ref. 2, 7248, 52193).  Males construct (Ref. 2, 13337) and defend (Ref. 2) a nest in shallowish waters (Ref. 2, 13337), which is a central volcano-shaped mound (Ref. 2, 314, 364, 5214, 13337, 55074) with a flat or slightly concave top which is the mating platform, surrounded by a ditch and vallum (groove and boundary wall) (Ref. 2).  The cone is higher than the boundary wall of the territory (Ref. 2).  Spawns in waters up to 150 cm deep, along banks of the lakes/river (Ref. 2).  Males court several females in succession and females may mate with more than one male in a summer, so that large populations of young may build up (Ref. 5214).  Several nests are often grouped into an arena (Ref. 5214, 7248, 36094, 52193).",y
728,Oreochromis mortimeri,in mouth,external brooders,NA,"Nest a saucer-shaped depression with a raised mound in the middle (Ref. 12524, 13337), made by the male in a breeding arena in shallow water down to about 4m (Ref. 54048). Females are lured to these through male courtship displays; female collects eggs in mouth after spawning and fertilisation, and moves off; mouthbrooding females may shoal together and do not feed at this time; eggs hatch after about ten days but remain in the mouth for a further few days; juveniles make short feeding sorties once the storage yolk is used up, but seldom stray far and dart into her mouth when danger threatens; after about another 10 days young are released in warm shallow water in the margins (nursery areas), where they feed independently in small shoals (Ref. 54048). Young released from mouthbrooding female are about 1cm long (Ref. 2). Female returns to the breeding arena where she spawns again (Ref. 54048).",y
729,Oreochromis mossambicus,external,external brooders,NA,"Spawns at the edge of the littoral terrace of lakes (Ref. 1, 2, 87, 6465), in sandy or muddy bottoms (Ref. 57425). Displays a lek mating system; territorial males establish breeding territories where they dig spawning pits, assume a dark coloration, defend a breeding territory and actively court females; sneaking males intrude into nests during a spawning episode, exhibiting quivering behavior which is usually an indicator of sperm release; sneaking is predominantly performed by subordinate males, which may adopt pseudo-female behavior (Ref. 57425). Only territorial males produce sounds, during all phases of courtship but especially during the late stages, including spawning (Ref. 49830). Territorial male excavates and defends a basin-shaped pit in the center of his territory, where female deposits 100-1700(1800) eggs (Ref. 44894, 52307). Eggs and milt are sucked up by the female (Ref. 2, 44894). Fertilization is reported to sometimes occur in the mouth of the female (Ref. 6028). Females incubate eggs alone (Ref. 12501, 52307). It is possible, albeit rare, that males take up some eggs after spawning (Ref. 2, 5726, 52307, 57895), but they almost always eat them soon after (Ref. 52307). Females school together while mouthbrooding (Ref. 40035), they cease to feed and subsist on food reserves stored in their body (Ref. 1). Females may spawn a full clutch with just one male, or may spawn with several different males in a series (Ref. 52307). Water is circulated over the eggs by chewing movements of the jaws (Ref. 12501, 12522). Fry hatch in the female's mouth after 3-5 days (Ref. 2, 12501, 12522, 44894, 52307), depending on the temperature (Ref. 52307). The young are released from the mouth in 10-14 days, but remain near the female and enter the mouth if threatened until about 3 weeks old (Ref. 2, 44894, 52307). Fry and juveniles shoal in shallow water (Ref. 6465, 7248, 57895) where they feed during the day, and retreat to deep water at night (Ref. 87, 6465). Females raise multiple broods during a season (Ref. 7248, 57895).",y
