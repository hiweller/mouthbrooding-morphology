3,Betta akarensis,NA,external brooders,NA,"A paternal mouth brooder, exhibiting the typical egg exchange between female and male. After the nuptial embrace, the female picks up the fertilized egg from the male's curved body, proceeds to transfer the eggs to the male for oral brooding by spitting out the eggs and the male gulps the eggs into its buccal sac. Male sometimes rejects the eggs, but the female continues spitting and gulping the eggs until the male finally accepts. This process continues until all the fertilized eggs have been transferred, then another bout of egg laying occurs with the whole procedure repeated.",y

20,Macropodus opercularis,external,nesters,NA,"The species is a bubble-nest builder; the male swims to the surface, draws a little air into his mouth and envelops it in a film of saliva thereby forming bubbles; upon building the nest, the male drives the female towards it; female spawns then male follows; male picks up the fertilized eggs in his mouth and pushes one by one into each bubble of the nest; male guards eggs until hatching (Ref. 5258).

Male solely guards the eggs and young until they reach free-swimming stage and are independent one week after spawning.",n
23,Osphronemus exodon,external,nesters,NA,"Builds a small nest, made of leaves and roots of a plant named ""gohk kai"" in Takam, just below the Lee Pee Waterfalls in southern Laos. Eggs and young are guarded by one parent as observed in the Mekong basin at Stung Treng.",n

Hatching takes place in 12 to 24 hours while the male parent continues to protect the nest.  In about three days, the developing larvae become free-swimming and leave the nest.  In an aquarium setting, it is about this same period that the male should be removed from the tank to lessen the probability of him eating the young (Ref. 1672).",n
