# What's mouthbrooding?

It's when fish keep their eggs or fry in their mouths instead of in a nest.

# Why is it interesting?

Because mouthbrooders have to use their mouths to feed, breathe, and reproduce, which places a lot of constraints on the same set of parts. It's also evolved at least 23 separate times. I think that can tell us a lot about how evolutionary transitions happen, and how existing phenotypes make [certain evolutionary pathways more likely than others](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/article/exaptationa-missing-term-in-the-science-of-form/A672662BA208D220B9F9A06DE5D804B8). 

# What is this?

A repository for code, landmark data, notes, and analysis for the first part of my PhD thesis. I'm trying to figure out whether mouthbrooders share certain morphological traits, and whether those traits ever arise for reasons other than mouthbrooding. In other words, when it comes to mouthbrooding, what comes first: the morphology or the behavior?

# Who is it for?

Me, future me, and possibly Hern√°n.

# If it's just for you, why is there explanatory text?

A combination of vanity, boredom, and yak shaving, I think.
