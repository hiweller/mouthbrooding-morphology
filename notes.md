# Why did mouthbrooding evolve?

Mouthbrooding has been hypothesized to provide three categories of reproductive benefit:

1. **Reducing predation.** Anyone who can't eat you can't eat your eggs. There are a couple of documented exceptions to this in the Rift Valley lakes, but mouthbrooders generally lose fewer offspring to predation.

2. **Coping with environmental instability.** Mouthbrooder offspring are inherently portable. If the parents are reproducing in a habitat prone to instability of some kind -- wet and dry seasons, high flow rates, lack of available nesting sites, etc -- the ability to take your offspring elsewhere can be advantageous.

3. **Oxygenating eggs.** This one is dubious, but plausible: by tumbling the eggs in the mouth (an action that resembles "chewing" the eggs), parents can keep water flowing on all sides. This active pumping may help to reduce the number of eggs lost to hypoxia, or reduce the amount of energy required by the parent to keep the eggs ventilated<sup>1</sup>.

Any reproductive strategy that allows parents to cart their offspring around with them will access these benefits; the external brood pouches of syngnathids (seahorses & their relatives) achieve similar results.

But brood pouches have a higher barrier to entry than mouthbrooding. All you need to become a mouthbrooder, strictly speaking, is a mouth. This is a requirement most fishes already fulfill. (Sorry hagfish.)

So from this perspective, the evolution of mouthbrooding at all is not surprising. Any fish whose offspring mortality is determined mostly by the above three factors (predation, environmental instability, and poor ventilation) will, in theory, have better juvenile survivorship when mouthbrooding.

But this reasoning ignores a pretty crucial nuance: fish are already using their mouths for feeding and breathing. Adding "baby carriage" to the list of functions that the oral cavity has to fulfill places even more constraints on an already fairly constrained structure. We might reasonably expect that the advantages of mouthbrooding will depend just as much on how fish look as on where they live.

Instead, the better question is:

# Why have some groups evolved mouthbrooding *so many times*?

Nine fish families include mouthbrooders, all of whom either live on coral reefs or in complex, crowded freshwater environments (Southeast Asia and the Amazon basin). These habitats certainly pose the risks stated above, so that's consistent.

Then we run into a couple of issues.

First, mouthbrooding is almost never the dominant form of parental care in a given assemblage, even if most of the fish species exhibit parental care. We could explain this as a function of evolutionary probability -- just because a trait is advantageous does not mean it is guaranteed to occur, and just because it occurs does not mean it will become fixed. This might be the case for seven of these fish families, in whom mouthbrooding seems to have evolved only once. The pressure existed, the mutations occurred by chance, and the populations evolved.

Here we run into the second issue: gouramis have evolved mouthbrooding at least 4 times, and cichlids have evolved mouthbrooding at least 12 times. That is, of the ~23 times mouthbrooding has evolved, *one family accounts for at least half of the times this parental care strategy has evolved*.

There is no combination of predation, environmental, and physiological factors that has so far been able to explain this propensity. You'll often see mouthbrooding and non-mouthbrooding sister taxa occupying the same rivers, exposed to the same risks, one of them happily mouthbrooding and the other happily not-mouthbrooding, both of them apparently sticking it out just fine.

What gives?



<sup>1 The trouble with this argument is that the exact opposite could also be true. Shutting all the eggs into the semi-enclosed space of the oral cavity could drastically increase the likelihood of some of those eggs suffocating. This is why this is third on the list.</sup>
